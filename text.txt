Google Wallet says it has changed its policy when storing users' funds as they will now be federally-insured (file photo) For those who use Google Wallet, their money just became safer with federal-level insurance. Google confirmed to Yahoo Finance in a statement that its current policy changed - meaning the company will store the balances for users of the mobile transfer service (similar to PayPal and Venmo) in multiple federally-insured banking institutions. This is good news for people who place large amounts of money in their Wallet Balance because the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insures funds for banking institutions up to $250,000. Currently, Google's user agreement says funds are not protected by the FDIC. However, a Google spokesperson told Yahoo Finance that the current policy has changed.
